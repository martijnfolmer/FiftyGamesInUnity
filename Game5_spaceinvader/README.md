# Space Invaders with 2 tanks

Start date : 15-06-2023

End date : 16-06-2023

This is the fifth game in my attempt to learn more about programming in unity by making 50 games. 

This is the first game in this series where I try to add something a little bit new to the concept. There are two tanks,
and you can control them both, and they block eachother from moving. There is not particular reason for doing this
apart from ease of implementation, and it is kind of hard to control. But it works and shows exactly why you wouldn't 
want to do this. Good practice though.

What can I do better?
- Need to be better aware of object oriented best practices. Some of the code repeats itself and some functionality 
should be put inside of other game objects instead of a general repository
- Little effects when bullets collide and sounds playing would help with satisfying game feel quite a lot.

Features I could have added with more time:
- A in indication what the controls are (A/D and W for moving and shooting with blue tank, arrow keys for yellow tank)
- Adjustable difficulty
- A highscore/scoring system
- A reset button
